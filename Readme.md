This is a Python program that simulates the spread of an illness in a network of people represented on a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Tkinter. The simulation visualizes the spread of the disease using the Tkinter GUI library in Python. The graph is created using the data from a text file called "produced_graph.txt", which contains the connections between nodes in the graph. The user can specify the number of connections (K) and the number of total nodes (N) through a Tkinter GUI window.

The simulation starts with one person being ill and spreading the disease to their neighbours with a certain probability. The ill person can recover after a certain number of days or die. The color of each node represents its health condition: yellow for ill, blue for cured, and black for dead. The user can progress the simulation by clicking the "New Day" button, which updates the health conditions of each node based on the rules described above.
