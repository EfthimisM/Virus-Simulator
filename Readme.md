This is a Python program that simulates the spread of an illness in a network of people represented on a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Tkinter. The GUI will display the individuals in the network as blue, yellow, or black circles, with blue representing healthy people, yellow representing individuals who are ill, and black representing individuals who have died from the illness. The code creates a graph that connects individuals in the network and sets the initial health condition of one of the individuals as ill. The spread of the illness is simulated by updating the health condition of the individuals in the network each day. The spread is determined based on a random number generator and the number of days the individuals have been ill, the number of connections each individual has, the number of victims in the network, and the death rate of the illness. The code also allows the user to specify these parameters through a pop-up window.
